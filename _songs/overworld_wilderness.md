Overworld Wilderness is a track used as overworld music for the XBox Live Arcade / Steam game Breath of Death VII. This track represents a cliche in older console-like RPG games of the 16-bit era and earlier, to provide the player an adventurous back tone to the exporation of new areas in overworld and area maps.
